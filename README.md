# ðŸ¤– v/s ðŸ‘¨: Turing Test for Humans

This project is an interactive experiment that challenges users to distinguish between sentences written by humans and those generated by AI. Inspired by the concept of the Turing Test, this imitation game is designed to test not only a machine's ability to mimic human behavior but also a human's ability to identify machine-generated text.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to promote AI literacy by encouraging users to engage in a "reverse Turing Test." Users are presented with a sentence and asked to guess whether it was written by a human or generated by an AI model. This exercise highlights the advancements in AI-generated text and the challenges of distinguishing it from human-written content.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay:** Users can test their ability to identify AI-generated sentences through a command-line interface.
- **Machine Learning Pipeline:** The project uses a Logistic Regression model trained on text data, with features extracted using TF-IDF vectorization.
- **Preprocessing and Training:** The provided data is split into training and testing sets, and the model is trained to distinguish between human and AI-generated sentences.
- **Random Sentence Selection:** Each round of the game presents a randomly selected sentence from the test set, ensuring a unique experience each time.

## How It Works

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - The dataset (`Training_Essay_Data.csv`) contains sentences labeled as either human-written or AI-generated.
   - The text data is vectorized using `TfidfVectorizer` to transform the text into numerical features.

2. **Model Training:**
   - A Logistic Regression model is trained on the vectorized text data to classify sentences as either human-written or AI-generated.

3. **Gameplay:**
   - The `guess_the_sentence()` function randomly selects a sentence from the test set.
   - The user is prompted to guess whether the sentence was written by a human or an AI model.
   - The model's prediction and the user's guess are compared to determine the outcome.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/avirooppal/Text-Based-Turning-Test-.git
   cd Text-Based-Turning-Test-
   ```

2. **Install the required packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Prepare your data:**

   Ensure you have the `Training_Essay_Data.csv` file in the project directory. This file should contain the text data and corresponding labels.

## Usage

To start the Turing Test for Humans, simply run:

```bash
python app.py
```

### Example Interaction

```text
Sentence: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
Was this sentence written by a human or generated by an AI model? (Enter 'human' or 'ai') human
Correct!
```

## Motivation

Inspired by the "Reverse Turing Test" experiment with AI NPCs trying to identify other AI entities, this project aims to deepen understanding of AI and its capabilities. By engaging with this game, users can sharpen their analytical skills and gain a better appreciation for the subtle differences between human and AI-generated text.
